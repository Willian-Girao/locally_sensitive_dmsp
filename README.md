# Locally Sensitive Data Mule Scheduling Proglem (W.I.P.)

Ongoing research project on data managemente and information retrieval within sensor networks under locally sensitive topology restrictions.

### Expored/Proposed methods

- Greedy
- Convex-Hull
- Alpha-Shape

### Results

- [With Acks](https://github.com/Willian-Girao/locally_sensitive_dmsp/blob/master/alpha_shape_2D/solver/Results/README.md)
- Without Acks
